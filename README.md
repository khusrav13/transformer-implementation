# Transformer From Scratch - Complete Project Overview

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762


## Project Goal
Build a fully functional encoder-decoder transformer from scratch that can perform real NLP tasks like translation, summarization, or text generation.

## Complete Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current Phase)
**Goal**: Master the attention mechanism and core mathematical concepts  
**Projection**: Implement and test scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention, and positional encoding

### Phase 2: Building Blocks
**Goal**: Create reusable transformer components  
**Projection**: Build encoder and decoder blocks with all necessary layers

### Phase 3: Full Architecture
**Goal**: Assemble the complete transformer model  
**Projection**: Stack layers into full encoder-decoder architecture with proper initialization

### Phase 4: Training Pipeline
**Goal**: Create a complete training system  
**Projection**: Implement data loading, training loops, and optimization strategies

### Phase 5: Real Applications
**Goal**: Train on actual NLP tasks  
**Projection**: Achieve reasonable performance on translation or text generation
